Design Decisions:
    - User Login or use IP
        - use IP for now, we can add users later

TABLE: RATINGS

|-- Rating ID (Key) --|-- User (Key) --|-- Timestamp --|-- Artist (Key) --|-- Baddie --|-- Banger --|
* Currently, User is just IP Address
* Rating ID is just an enumeration of the ratings, this might be an issue in the future

TABLE: ARTISTS - need security for admin updating artist
|-- Artist (Key) --|-- Spotify URL --|

TABLE: USERS
|-- User (Key) --|-- Password --|
