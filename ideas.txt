Design Decisions:
    - User Login or use IP
        - use IP for now, we can add users later

SQL Persistence Schema:
TABLE: RATINGS
|-- Rating ID (Key) --|-- User (Key) --|-- Timestamp --|-- Artist (Key) --|-- Baddie --|-- Banger --|
* Currently, User is just IP Address
* Rating ID is just an enumeration of the ratings, this might be an issue in the future

TABLE: ARTISTS - need security for admin updating artist
|-- Artist (Key) --|-- Spotify URL --|

TABLE: USERS
|-- User (Key) --|-- Password --|


Firestore Persistence Schema (free):

user-ratings (collection):
    _metadata (document)
        all-users (field) # list of all users
    user-1 (document):
        name (field)
        password (field)
        all-ratings (field)
        ratings (collection): # note, you need to create a _dummy rating on creation of a user
            id (document)
                timestamp (field)
                artist (field)
                baddie (field)
                banger (field)
        ...
    user-2
    ...

artists (collection):
    _metadata (document)
        all-artists (field) # list of all artists
